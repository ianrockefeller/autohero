procedural generation of the world

documentation:
- World
  - the world is a sphere represented as a 2D plane
  - each cell of the plane is represented by a position in the 2d array implementation
  - each cell is its own biosphere

dimensions: 
- potential evapotranspiration ratio
  - 0.125 (1) - 32
- annual precipitation 
  - 62.5 (500) - 16000 mm
- critical temperature line
  - < 0C - 24C+
- humidity
  - super-arid, perarid, ardi, semi-arid, sub-humid, humid, per-humid, super-humid

tropical zone
- sun nearly vertical
- high temps, more evaporation, moist air, dense cloud cover

subtropics
- sun vertical
- thin cloud cover, less moisture, most deserts are here, can be cool and moist during winter

temperate zone
- sun is at a slight angle
- cooler than subtropics, less extreme temp, regular distribution of rain over year, longer vegetation

cold zone
- sun has a very flat angle

what is the axis of the world's rotation in relation to its sun?

Season Types:
- winter, fall, summer, spring


givens:
world size

# logic
- randomly start in a cell and build out from there
  - start with the terrain
    - the starting terrain dictates the terrain around it
